Conway's Game of Life in Python

A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Python and Pygame. Conway's Game of Life is a classic cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It's a zero-player game where the evolution of the grid is determined by its initial state.

Features:
Visualizes the evolution of the grid with Pygame.
The grid is initialized with random values.
Applies Conway's rules for cell survival and reproduction.
Adjustable grid size, cell size, and simulation speed.
How to Run:
Clone this repository: git clone 
Navigate to the project directory: cd conways-game-of-life
Install Pygame: pip install pygame
Run the script: python conways_game_of_life.py
Feel free to tweak the parameters in the code to customize the simulation according to your preferences.

Enjoy exploring the fascinating patterns that emerge in Conway's Game of Life!
