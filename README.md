# Conway's Game of Life in Python

![Conway's Game of Life](conways_game_of_life.gif)

A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Python and Pygame. Conway's Game of Life is a classic cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It's a zero-player game where the evolution of the grid is determined by its initial state.

## Features:
- Visualizes the evolution of the grid with Pygame.
- The grid is initialized with random values.
- Applies Conway's rules for cell survival and reproduction.
- Adjustable grid size, cell size, and simulation speed.

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/eliadjoke/Conway-Game-of-Life.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd conways-game-of-life`
3. Install Pygame: `pip install pygame`
4. Run the script: `python conways_game_of_life.py`

Feel free to tweak the parameters in the code to customize the simulation according to your preferences.

Enjoy exploring the fascinating patterns that emerge in Conway's Game of Life!
